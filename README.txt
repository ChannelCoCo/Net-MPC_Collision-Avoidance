This project is implemented by Bassam Alrifaee, from 
the RWTH Aachen University, during his PhD thesis 
titled "Networked Model Predictive Control for Vehicle Collision 
Avoidance". Helpful contributions were made by the following students:
Janis Maczijewski, Marwan Chawa, Mohamed Hetaba, Mostafa Nabil, 
Kevin Kostyszyn, Mark Azer, Masoumeh G. Mamaghani

Also thanks to Arthur Richards' work which provided a starting point 
for the initial implementation.: A. G. Richards and J. P. How, 
"Aircraft Trajectory Planning with Collision Avoidance using Mixed 
Integer Linear Programming" in Proceedings of the American Control 
Conference, 2002.

# MATLAB code (Tested with version R2016a)

# Dependencies
    # CPLEX (Tested with version 12.6.3)
        * Download and install IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio.
		* CPLEX is free for academics, search for "IBM Academic Initiative"
        * Set the path in 'startup.m'.

# Usage
    # startup.m
        Run the startup to setup libraries and paths.

    # main.m
        If you run 'main.m' you will be prompted to select a scenario and controller.
        The simulation will start and show a live plot at each simulation step.
        The simulation result will be saved in 'output/<scenarioName>.<controllerName>/'.
        You can press <space> to pause and continue the simulation or <escape> to abort.







# Controller Interface
	All controllers have a common interface:
    [U,trajectoryPrediction,controllerOutput] = controller(scenario,iter,previousOutput)
    
    * U
        The predicted steering angles for all prediction steps and vehicles, matrix(Hp, nVeh).
    * trajectoryPrediction
        The predicted trejectory of all vehicles for all prediction steps, matrix(Hp,ny,nVeh).
    * controllerOutput
        A struct with optional outputs.
    
    * scenario
        A struct describing the scenario. For more see 'defaultScenario()'.
    * iter
        Time-variant controller inputs (current vehicle/obstacle states, reference trajectories, etc).
    * previousOutput
        The 'controllerOutput' from the previous iteration. Useful for initializing
        an optimizer with the last result. Empty on the first iteration.
